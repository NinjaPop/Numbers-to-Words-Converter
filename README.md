-	Open up Eclipse IDE

	work with: 2021-03 - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/2021-03 > tick; Web, XML, JAVA EE â€¦ and install.
	
-	Navigate in File > Import > Web > WAR file > Next > Browse > Find the TechOneTest.war file > Finish

-	NOTE: If Target runtime is empty we need to create a server, navigate to > New > Apache > Apache Tomcat v9.0 > tick Create a new local server > Next 
	> Choose an Installation directory > click download and install > install > finish

-	NOTE: Apache Tomcat can also be downloaded from their original website at(https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi) and setup through server tab on eclipse
	>if downloaded manually or server not showing in server tab, to add the server right click in the server tab down screen > new > server > find Apache > Tomcat 9.0 > 
	next > navigate and select folder, manual(program files/Apache software Foundation/Tomcat 9.0) > finish
	
-	On bottom panel Servers > double click Tomcat v9.0 > make sure Tomcat admin port = any other port other than "-"
